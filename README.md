# Library Management System

## Project Description

This project was implemented for learning purposes. I wanted to understand/implement different features offered by Sql Server, such as creating Stored Procedures, Views, and writing complex query statements used for data analysis. The data used for the application was taken from kaggle.com, as well as randomly generated data using Microsoft Excel. Integration services was used to load data from excel/flat files into a normalized database, and from the database into a data warehouse using a tabular model. Each table from the tabular model was then loaded into Power Bi for report building.

## Technologies Used

* SQL(T-SQL)
* Sql Server Management Studio - 2016
* Visual Studio W/SSDT - 2017
* Microsoft Excel
* MS Integration Services
* MS Analysis Services
* Power Bi

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Data visualization and interactive reports in Power Bi.
* Complex queries used to create views and data analysis, such as the conversion rate for overdue books.
* Implemented stored procedures and views using Sql Server.
* Integration Services that perform different techniques for incremental loading.
* Microsoft Excel used to generate random data.
* Wrote Dax Expressions to created calculated columns and measures.

To-do list:
* Learn and implement more queries that provide insight for data analysis.
* Perform further data cleaning.
* Implement the tuning advisor further.
* Possibly implement indexes.
* Omit the member id column from overdue table.

## Getting Started
   
(include git clone command)
(include all environment setup steps)

> Be sure to include BOTH Windows and Unix command  
> Be sure to mention if the commands only work on a specific platform (eg. AWS, GCP)

- All the `code` required to get started
- Images of what it should look like

## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
